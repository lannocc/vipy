vipy
====

A vim-like text-mode editor as a Python module.

CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME: this is a work in progress.


Why vipy?
---------

Because I was working remotely on a Windows machine through SSH that had Python installed, and I needed an editor.


Requirements
------------

Python 3.6 or higher. This "editor" should work on Linux, MacOS/BSD, and Windows.


Installing
----------

Install through pip::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/lannocc/vipy


Using
-----

Once installed, you can start a blank editor::

    vipy

Edit a new or existing file::

    vipy myfile.txt

See the help screen::

    vipy --help


More to come later.
