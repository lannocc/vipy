vipy
====

A vim-like text-mode editor as a Python module.

CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME: this is a work in progress.


Why vipy?
---------

Because I was working remotely on a Windows machine through SSH that had Python installed, and I needed an editor.


Installing
----------

Install through pip::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/lannocc/vipy

More documentation may come later.
